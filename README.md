# Laravel Countries

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-countries
```

To get started, you'll need to publish the vendor assets and migrate the countries table:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BrianFaust\Countries\CountriesServiceProvider" && php artisan migrate
```

Now you can seed the countries into the database like this.

```bash
php artisan seed:countries
```

## Testing

``` bash
$ phpunit
```

## Security
